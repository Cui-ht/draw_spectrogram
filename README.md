# draw_spectrogram
Produces a "Praat style" spectrogram of an audio(.wav) file using Short Time Fourier Transformation with Gaussian window function. 
Uses Python packages librosa, matplotlib and scipy.
Might be handy for phonetians who are more familiar with this kind than a default librosa "specshow" method gragh.
