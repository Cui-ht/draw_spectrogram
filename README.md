# draw_spectrogram
Produces a "Praat style" spectrogram of an audio(.wav) file using Short Time Fourier Transformation with Gaussian window function. 

## Who is this for?
Might be handy for phonetians who are (like me) more familiar with this kind than a default librosa "specshow" method graph.

## Dependencies
Python packages librosa, matplotlib and scipy.

## Example
![me-phonetics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57549068/144840971-06e89f0d-cef0-4b66-af3a-e19bbfe0a63c.png)
Me saying "phonetics". The original file name is "me-phonetics.wav", therefore the title and picture name are also "me-phonetics."
