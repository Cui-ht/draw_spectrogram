# draw_spectrogram
Produces a "Praat style" spectrogram of an audio(.wav) file using Short Time Fourier Transformation with Gaussian window function. 

## Dependencies
Python packages librosa, matplotlib and scipy.

## Who is this for?
Might be handy for phonetians who are (like me) more familiar with this kind than a default librosa "specshow" method graph.
